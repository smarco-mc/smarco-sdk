# Smart Core Silicon Software Development Kit

This repository contains OpenEmbedded/Yocto SDK for Smart Core silicon
chips.

## Quick Start

Install `repo` command from Google if not available on your host system.
Please follow [the official instructions](https://source.android.com/setup/develop#installing-repo) by Google.

Then install a number of packages for BitBake (OE build tool) to work
properly on your host system. BitBake itself depends on Python 3. Once you
have Python 3 installed BitBake should be able to tell you most of the
missing packages.

> For Ubuntu 18.04 (or newer) install python3-distutils package.

Detailed instructions for various distributions can be found in
"[Required Packages for the Build Host](http://docs.yoctoproject.org/ref-manual/system-requirements.html#required-packages-for-the-build-host)" section in Yocto Project Reference Manual.
